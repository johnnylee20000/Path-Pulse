## Mission Title  
**Operation: First Pulse**

## Target  
**5.0 km (3.1 miles)** recorded in a single session.

## Rewards

- **The Origin Badge:** Exclusive iridescent holographic badge only available on Launch Day.
- **XP Multiplier:** Permanent 1.5× XP boost for the first 30 days.
- **Social Ritual:** Users must share their Tactical Time-Lapse from this walk with the "First Pulse" overlay.

## The Twist

As users complete the mission, a **live "Global Map"** on the website lights up with Neon Cyan dots in real time, showing where the grid is being activated.

**Outcome:** By end of Launch Day, 1,000 high-quality, high-tech videos flood social media with the same aesthetic → strong FOMO for those without an invite.
