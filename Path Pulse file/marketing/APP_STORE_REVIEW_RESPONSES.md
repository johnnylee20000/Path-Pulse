## 1. The 5-Star Rave (Brand Evangelist)

**User:** "This app changed my life. The AR Ghost is insane!"

**Response:**  
"Welcome to the elite, Explorer. Your data profile is looking optimal. We've notified PRISM of your progress—she's impressed. Keep tracing that grid. See you at Level 100."

## 2. The 1-Star Technical Glitch (Frustrated Recruit)

**User:** "App keeps crashing on my older phone. Waste of time."

**Response:**  
"Systems check required. Pathfinder, we hate to see a mission interrupted. The Kinetic Engine is high-performance; our tech squad is optimizing the 'Legacy Hardware' patch. Please send your diagnostic log to support@pathpulse.lab so we can get you back on the grid."

## 3. The "Too Intense" Review (Skeptic)

**User:** "It's a bit much... I just wanted a simple step counter."

**Response:**  
"We hear you. Path-Pulse is a high-intensity Lab, not just a pedometer. If you're looking for 'basic,' the legacy apps have you covered. If you're looking for evolution, stick with the protocol. The first 10 levels are the hardest—don't let the Ghost win."
