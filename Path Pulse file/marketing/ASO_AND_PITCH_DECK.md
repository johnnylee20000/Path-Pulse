## Part 2: Pitch Deck (10 Slides)

1. **The Vision** — Path-Pulse: The Biological Operating System. We are building the interface between human kinetic movement and digital precision.
2. **The Problem** — Fitness apps are boring, inaccurate, and dated. Users are "tracking-fatigued"; no actionable data or social prestige.
3. **The Solution** — High-immersion Tactical Lab that gamifies biology: "Expeditions" instead of workouts, Terrain-Aware Precision instead of generic calories.
4. **The Tech Moat** — Kinetic Engine with barometric + ARKit; Terrain Multiplier (Tm) that standard apps ignore. TotalBurn = (BMR × t) × Tm.
5. **The Market** — Data Nerd + Weight-Loss Warrior segments; 2026 digital health market value $120B+.
6. **Product (Titan Build)** — AR Ghost-Path (retention), Bio-Sync Audio (immersion), Tactical Time-Lapses (viral), Predictive Fueling (LTV).
7. **Business Model** — Freemium core; Pro-Lab $14.99/mo (AR Ghosting, Predictive Fueling, 4K Time-Lapse); Protocol meal-prep partnerships.
8. **Traction** — Signal Scramble + Alpha 1,000 invite-only rollout for 0% churn and maximum hype.
9. **Roadmap** — Q1: MVP; Q2: Social Raids; Q3: Wearable (Path-Pulse Watch-OS).
10. **The Ask** — "Seeking [X] to scale AR engine and onboard first 100,000 Explorers."
