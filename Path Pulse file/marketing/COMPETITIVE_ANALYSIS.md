## Why Path-Pulse Wins

1. **From Shame to Discovery** — Strava/MFP rely on streaks and leaderboards → burnout. Path-Pulse: objective Lab framing ("Bio-Baseline Stable. Fueling protocol adjusted.").

2. **Terrain Multiplier (Tm)** — Most apps treat 5 km treadmill = 5 km beach. Path-Pulse gives hidden credit (e.g. sand = 2.1×). Data Nerds choose the hard path because the app validates it.

3. **Visual Prestige** — Legacy shares look like utility tools. Path-Pulse 3D Time-Lapses and AR Ghost clips are shareable, sci-fi, and position the user as a "Pathfinder."

## Tactical Strike

- **Vs Strava:** More immersive, solo-focused; race *your* Ghost on *your* street.
- **Vs MyFitnessPal:** Predictive Fueling instead of manual-entry headache.
- **Vs Whoop:** Elite-level biometric insights using phone + existing watch, no mandatory hardware.

**Verdict:** Path-Pulse wins by making health an *experience*—exploration and biology—not another to-do list.
