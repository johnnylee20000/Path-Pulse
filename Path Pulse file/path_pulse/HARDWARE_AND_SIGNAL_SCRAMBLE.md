# Hardware Testing & Signal Scramble Export

## Step 6: Run on a physical device

1. **Connect your phone** to your computer via USB.
2. **Enable USB debugging** (Android) or trust the computer (iOS).
3. In Cursor, **select your device** in the bottom-right (device selector).
4. Run the app: press **F5** or in the terminal run:
   ```bash
   cd path_pulse
   flutter run
   ```
5. The Obsidian UI should appear; you can sign the **Explorer's Oath** and start a mission. Tapping **START EXPEDITION** opens the AR Ghost-Path view (requires ARCore/ARKit).

## Step 7: Signal Scramble — TikTok teaser

1. **Record on device:** Use your phone’s **screen recorder** to capture:
   - Signing the Oath (tap **ACCEPT OATH & INITIALIZE GRID** — PRISM will speak).
   - Starting a mission (tap **START EXPEDITION** and, if available, the AR Ghost view).
2. **Edit with the teaser script** from `launch/SIGNAL_SCRAMBLE_TEASER_SCRIPT.md`:
   - 0:00–0:01 — Black, text: *SCANNING FOR BIO-SIGNALS...* + heartbeat.
   - 0:02–0:03 — Glitch + Neon Cyan line (Ghost-Path) on pavement.
   - 0:04–0:05 — Path-Pulse logo + *INITIALIZING 2026. THE GRID IS WATCHING.*
3. Post the clip to TikTok/Reels/Shorts with your chosen hashtags.
