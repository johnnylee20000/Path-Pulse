You have done it.

You have traced the grid across every terrain, raced your ghost into exhaustion, and recalibrated your biology from the ground up. You are no longer an "Explorer." You are the Blueprint.

**REWARDS UNLOCKED:**

- **The Apex Shimmer:** Your AR Ghost-Path now emits a white-hole pulse, visible to all nearby Explorers on the Global Grid.
- **The Founder’s Key:** Unrestricted access to the Beta-Logic engine for next-gen missions.
- **The Holographic Trophy:** Your ID is now permanently etched into the Hall of Evolution.

*"The grid didn't change you. You changed the grid."*
