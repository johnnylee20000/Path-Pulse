# Path-Pulse: The Explorer’s Oath

**Subject:** System Access & Biological Data Protocols  
**Status:** REQUIRED FOR INITIALIZATION

By tapping **"INITIALIZE SYSTEM"**, you (the **Explorer**) agree to the following protocols and terms of service.

---

## 1. The Bio-Data Protocol (Privacy)

- **Data Collection:** You authorize the Lab to sync with your device’s health sensors (GPS, Heart Rate, Biometrics).
- **Encryption:** Your biological data is encrypted and used solely for Diagnostic Reports and Metabolic Fueling plans.
- **Social Sharing:** Any Tactical Time-Lapses or Mission Briefings you share are at your discretion; once shared, they are visible on the "Global Grid."

## 2. Kinetic Liability (Safety)

- **Situational Awareness:** Maintain full awareness of your surroundings. Do not focus on the Tactical Overlay while crossing intersections or hazardous terrain.
- **Physical Limits:** Expeditions and Protocols are suggestions. If your body signals pain or exhaustion, stop. Path-Pulse is not liable for over-exertion or environmental hazards.

## 3. The Fueling & Nutrition Directive

- **Not Medical Advice:** Metabolic Fueling and Meal Prep are based on general nutrition and your logged data. They do not replace a doctor or nutritionist.
- **Accuracy:** Calorie counting is an estimate; the Lab is only as accurate as the data you input.

## 4. Code of the Global Grid (Conduct)

- **Fair Play:** Do not use vehicles (cars, bikes, drones) to spoof GPS data for rank.
- **Community Integrity:** In Community Raids, remain respectful. Toxic behavior may result in account suspension.

## 5. Termination of Link

- You may terminate this agreement at any time by deactivating your account. Upon deactivation, the Lab will remove your bio-stats from the active grid; some anonymized data may remain for system calibration.
