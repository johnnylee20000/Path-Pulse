# Path-Pulse — Project Brief

**Tagline:** Trace Your Path. Pulse Your Progress.

**Concept:** A high-tech "Bio-Explorer" utility that fuses GPS storytelling with clinical health analytics for Android and iOS.

## 1. Visual & Aesthetic Identity

- **Vibe:** 40% High-Tech Lab / 20% Minimalist Zen / 40% Futuristic Quest
- **UI/UX:** Obsidian Dark Mode (`#0B0E11`), Neon Cyan (`#00F5FF`), Electric Lime (`#39FF14`)
- **Key Icon:** The Pulse-Pointer — GPS pin integrated with a heartbeat waveform
- **Interface:** Glass-morphism layers, monospaced technical typography

---

## 2. Core Tracking & GPS

- **Tactical Trace:** Real-time GPS on a dark-vector map
- **Kinetic Time-Lapse:** 3D wireframe video of each walk with data call-outs (elevation, speed, peak HR)
- **Step Quality Index:** Cadence analysis — "Passive Steps" vs "Power Steps"

---

## 3. Bio-Diagnostic Suite (The Lab)

- **Body Composition Matrix:** BMI + 3D wireframe silhouette evolution
- **Metabolic Engine:** BMR, "Fat-to-Fuel" efficiency from walk intensity
- **Weekly Diagnostic Report:** "Declassified" mission summary (PDF/Video) every Sunday

---

## 4. Metabolic Fueling (Calorie & Meal Prep)

- **Fuel Gauge:** Real-time calorie counter (BMR + active burn vs intake)
- **Precision Meal Prep:** Ingredient scanner, Protocol recipes by expedition intensity
- **Hydration Logic:** Water needs from GPS-tracked route/sweat data

---

## 5. Quest-Log (Gamification)

- **Expeditions:** Missions like "Operation: Metabolism Spike", "The Urban Ridge"
- **Rank Progression:** Level 1 (Civilian) → Level 100 (Apex Pathfinder), map skins, Lab features
- **Community Raids:** Co-op step challenges with friends

---

## 6. Business & Tech

- **Monetization:** Free tier (steps, basic BMI, standard maps); **Path-Pulse Pro** ($9.99/mo): advanced analytics, unlimited time-lapses, full Meal Prep/Calorie suite
- **Tech Stack:** Mapbox SDK, HealthKit/Health Connect, FFmpeg (video), AI for meal/walk protocols

---

## 7. Titan Update (Advanced Systems)

- **AR Ghost-Path:** Race your "past self" overlay in the real world
- **Bio-Sync Audio:** Music BPM aligned to heart rate zones
- **Terrain-Aware Calorie Precision:** Surface multiplier (sand, grass, pavement)
- **Predictive Fueling AI:** Meal suggestions based on next day’s expedition

---

## 8. Next Steps for Development

1. Prototype the Time-Lapse Engine (3D wireframe, shareable).
2. Integrate Calorie/Bio-Database with BMI trend graphs.
3. Beta launch "Operation: First Step" (30-day challenge).
