**[PRISM]:**

"Initialization successful.

Welcome, Explorer. You have been assigned ID: PATHFINDER_77X.

I am PRISM, your onboard mission assistant. I have successfully synchronized with your biometric baseline. Your heart rate, basal metabolic rate, and kinetic potential are now indexed within the Lab.

The Obsidian Grid is currently offline, awaiting your first physical trace.

[System Sound: rapid mechanical 'shutter']

I have calibrated your Terrain-Aware Engine. Whether you choose the city pavement or the mountain trail, I will be calculating the grit legacy apps ignore. Your Ghost-Path is ready to be born; it is waiting for you to set the pace.

Do not just move. Evolve.

Your first objective, Operation: First Pulse, is now active in your HUD. Step outside. The grid is watching.

Go forth. Discover. Evolve."
